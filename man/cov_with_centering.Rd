\title{Compute the covariance matrix with possible centering and the corresponding
concentration ratio}
\usage{
cov_with_centering(X, centeredCov)

concentr_ratio(n, p, centeredCov, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{X, n, p}{data matrix (rows are observations, columns are features).
\code{n} is the number of observations of the data matrix, and \code{p}
is the number of features}

\item{centeredCov}{Boolean variable. If \code{TRUE}, the covariance matrix is
computed using centering (i.e. in the general case where the mean of the
random vector may be non-zero).
If \code{FALSE} the covariance matrix is computed assuming that the mean of
the random vector of interest is \code{0} (i.e. does not need to be estimated).}

\item{verbose}{a number indicating whether to print intermediary values and
details about the progress of the computations. A value of \code{0} indicates
no printing at all, while higher values indicate increasingly more detailed
(more verbose) output.}
}
\value{
\code{cov_with_centering} returns a \code{p * p} matrix.
\code{concentr_ratio} returns a numeric vector of length 1.

\description{
Having the number of dimensions \eqn{p}, the sample size \eqn{n} and the
corresponding observation matrix \eqn{\mathbf{X}_n}, the user can choose
between two versions of the sample covariance matrix: centered (mean is unknown)
and noncentered one (mean is known to be zero). The noncentered sample covariance matrix
(\code{centeredCov=FALSE}) is constructed simply by
\deqn{\mathbf{S}_n=\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{X}_n^\top\mathbf{X}_n\,.
}
In the case of unknown mean vector, one has to center the observation matrix
in the following way:
let \eqn{\mathbf{J}_n = \mathbf{I}_n - \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}_n \mathbf{1}_n^\top}
with \eqn{\mathbf{1}} being the \eqn{n}-dimensional vector with all entries equal to one.
Then, \eqn{\mathbf{J}_n} is a projection matrix of rank \eqn{n-1}.
As such, all \eqn{n-1} nonzero eigenvalues of \eqn{\mathbf{J}_n} are equal to
one, and its singular value decomposition is
\deqn{
 \mathbf{J}_n = \mathbf{H}_n \mathbf{H}_n^\top.
}
where \eqn{\mathbf{H}_n} is a \eqn{n \times (n-1)} orthogonal matrix, i.e.,
\eqn{\mathbf{H}_n^\top \mathbf{H}_n = \mathbf{I}_{n-1}}. Then, the centered sample
covariance matrix (\code{centeredCov=TRUE}) is defined in the following way
\deqn{
 \mathbf{S}_n
 = \frac{1}{n-1} \mathbf{X}^\top_n \mathbf{J}_n \mathbf{X}_n
 = \frac{1}{n-1} \tilde{\mathbf{X}}^\top_n \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_n,
 \quad \text{with} \quad
 \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_n = \mathbf{H}^\top_n\mathbf{X}_n.
 }
Similarly, the concentration ratio in the noncentered case is defined by
\eqn{c_n=\frac{p}{n}}, while in the centered one it is given by
\eqn{c_n=\frac{p}{n-1}}. Even though this difference looks somewhat subtle, it
can have some significant influence on the performance of the estimators in
finite sample regime.
