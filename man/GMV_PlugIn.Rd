\title{Compute the optimal portfolio weights given an (estimated) precision matrix}
\usage{
GMV_PlugIn(estimatedPrecisionMatrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimatedPrecisionMatrix}{a matrix of size \eqn{p \times p}, which
is estimating the precision matrix \eqn{\Sigma^{-1}}
( = the inverse of the covariance matrix of the vector of asset returns that
are considered).}
}
\value{
a vector of size \eqn{p} with the computed portfolio weights, with
the minimum variance, i.e. the portfolio that has the lowest variance among
all portfolios.
}
\description{
This functions return the optimal portfolio weights defined by
\deqn{
w = \dfrac{\Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}^T \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{1}}
}
i.e. \eqn{w = (w_1, \dots, w_p)} where for \eqn{j = 1, \dots, p}, we have
\deqn{
w_j = \dfrac{\sum_{k=1}^p [\Sigma^{-1}]_{j,k}}{
\sum_{k,l = 1}^p [\Sigma^{-1}]_{k,l}}.
}
Here \eqn{\mathbf{1}} is a vector \eqn{1} of size \eqn{p}, and
\eqn{\Sigma^{-1}} is the precision matrix (or an estimator thereof), of size
\eqn{p \times p}, where \eqn{p} is the number of assets that are considered
and \eqn{\Sigma} is the covariance matrix of the vector of asset returns.
