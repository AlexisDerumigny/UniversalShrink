\usage{
higher_order_shrinkage(Y, Pi0 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{data matrix (rows are features, columns are observations).
TODO: transpose everything.}

\item{Pi0}{prior of the precision matrix. This a \code{p} by \code{p} matrix, used as
a target for the shrinkage. Default value is the identity matrix of size \code{p}.
As an advice, it should be a symmetric positive-definite matrix, but this is
not checked for.}
